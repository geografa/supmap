Like most sports now, you can track your trips and revel in the distances you've covered. Here, we cover some utilities to consider for tracking your paddles as well as planning them ahead of time.

It's relatively easy now to track your paddles through common phone and watch apps. When polled on the socials, many mention the following:

**Fitness apps**
- Paddle Logger
- Strava

**Sports watches**
- Garmin
- Suunto
- Apple Watch

Personally, I'm using Apple and Suunto watches with Strava so I'm covering those here. Paddle Logger seems to be a favorite among seasoned paddlers and we'll cover it once we get a complete review.
