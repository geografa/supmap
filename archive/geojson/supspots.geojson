Getting to Ross Island is pretty straightforward and very accessible from either Willamette Park or Sellwood Riverfront Park. There's lots of beach along Sellwood that you can hug for a while and if you're adventurous you can make it to the southern tip of Ross Island (aka \"Newb Beach\"). <img src=\"./assets/img/spots/ross-island-3.jpg\">Experienced paddlers will loop around the island for the 6 to 7 km trip or just hang out in the lagoon. This area gets really busy in the summer and lots of boats and jet skis will pass by. Be sure to stay out of the middle of the river and closer to shore (but watch out for remnant pilings as they will catch your fin and you'll be taking a dip)."
