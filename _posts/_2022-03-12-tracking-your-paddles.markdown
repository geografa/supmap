Like most sports now, you can track your trips and revel in the distances you've covered. I'll cover a few options in this series to try and demystify what you might want to look for in a GPS tracker and trip logger. As usual, there are quite a few opinions and these are my own so be sure to tap into your local groups and internet forums. For Part I, let's look at probably one of the most ubiquitous fitness apps out there, **Strava**.

## Strava
Strava is a terrific all-around fitness app and most popular among runners and cyclists. It's easy enough to track your SUP trips but there are some caveats when using it with a smartwatch which I'll cover later. One of Strava's most attractive qualities is its social features. Maybe it's just me, but I often think "who's gonna see this paddle when I post it?". Like IG, once you post a ride/paddle/run, your friends and followers can comment or give you 'Kudos'. I have to say, those thumbs are encouraging.

Here, we cover some utilities to consider for tracking your paddles as well as planning them ahead of time.
