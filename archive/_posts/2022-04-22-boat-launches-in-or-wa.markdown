Did you know there are over 1,759 watercraft launches in Oregon and Washington? At least, that's what we counted. The map below gives you some idea of where they all are and how to get to them. Hover over the locations to see their name and info. Oregon is more complete than Washington (more on that below).

The info for Oregon is from the [Oregon State Marine Board](https://www.oregon.gov/OSMB/Pages/index.aspx) (OSMB). Because the info for Washington is a little harder to get to ([WDFW](https://wdfw.wa.gov/places-to-go/water-access-sites?combine=&county=All)) we extracted the location info from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/47.302/-122.794). There's no guarantee that any of these sites are accesssible so be sure to check the source of truth ([WDFW](https://boat.wa.gov/boating-information-portal/places-to-go/) and [OSMB](https://www.oregon.gov/OSMB/Pages/index.aspx)).
